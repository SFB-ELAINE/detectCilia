already detected cilium)}

belong to a given cilium (inclusion volume))}

detected)}

detected)}

\description{
Main function for detecting cilia in images
}
\details{
Input should be tif-format.
At first, the cilia will be located by using the max intensity method
and reconnecting them with nearby pixels with the lower threshold.
Afterwards a linear regression is being calculated for each cilium
projection which determines the length a (horizontal plane). The length b
in the vertical plane is being determined by the numbers of z-slices
where the cilium can be found. The entire length of the cilium is being
calculated with c=sqrt(a^2+b^2).
The output will be written in the current directory.
Please be aware that the coordinate system is turned by 90Â° to the right.
The origin of the x- and y-axes is in the upper-left corner of the image.
(The x-axis points downwards and the y-axis to the right.)
