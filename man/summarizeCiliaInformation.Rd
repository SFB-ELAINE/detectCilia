\arguments{
\item{df_cilium_information}{A data frame with found cilia.}

\item{min_cilium_area}{A number for the minimum number of pixels needed
to represent a cilium.}

\item{pixel_size}{A number depicting the size of one pixel in micrometers.}

\item{slice_distance}{A number depicting the distance of two consecutive
z-stack layers in micrometers.}

\description{
`summarizeCiliaInformation()` summarizes the information of cilia found
by the main function detectCilia.R. The output is a data frame with the
lengths of the found cilia.
